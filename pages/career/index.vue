            <!-- Description -->
            <p>
              I’m a lifelong student first and foremost. I’m always trying to improve myself and learn new things. I’m interested in various fields, mostly coding, business, marketing, psychology, linguistics and anthropology.
            </p>
            <p>
              I am a seasoned programmer with more than 10 years in SaaS and am well versed in many languages. I try my best to thoroughly understand the technical challenges of each project going in and then choose the most effective platform / language to see it through. Recently most of the projects I’ve worked on have been based in Ruby on Rails, NodeJS and Laravel. I write clean, readable and scalable code.
            </p>
            <p>
              For the majority of my career I have been in a back-end  position. I’m good at dealing with the server side and know the importance of being able to adapt myself to any given situation / technology. I pride myself in being able to think through complex systems, anticipate problems, and fix them before they happen.

              This fast growing startup specialized in webinar and online meetings needed someone on the back-end to bulk up their technical team. After one year working as their top engineer I became the head of back-end development and started managing and leading three small teams. In my time there, we’ve managed to improve our architecture and infrastructure to handle ten times more traffic.

              This startup called me to help them technically ; unable to release a solid sino-germanic marketplace, they asked for help. I had to take the lead in a small team, completely rebuild their front-end, stabilize the whole back-end side and improve its speed / scalability. I established multiple processes such as CI/CD, programming good practices, testing, git organization, schedule boards and finally delivered a stable version after a few months.

              Created a  monthly delivery box company with two other associates and one graphic artist. I was the lead developer / project manager and created a very customized shopping cart tailored to the needs of our delivery service.  I engineered systems to handle customer leads, order flow, a recurring payment system using stripe (>50 000 euros growth), and a module that programmatically fulfilled orders. I also aggregated data that was collected from our users and build out a reporting module with several  easy to understand graphs that helped to make sense of many complex and relational data sets (>2 000 orders).

              In my hometown it was legal to sell alcohol late into the night, but most stores did not stay open late. There was a need  that no one was servicing. I teamed up with  one other associate  and created  a web based alcohol delivery service. We leveraged the power of social media in combination with an easy to use web interface that made ordering alcohol online easier than ordering a pizza. We started with a Minimum Valuable Product and after seeing success we began growing the usability of the ordering platform. Aside from improving the website, we created an App that customers could use as well to order from their phones. The company became very profitable very quickly. We however, found it difficult to grow outside of the local area for legal reasons. After overcoming all the technological challenges I started to grow bored with the business and ultimately sold the company for a nice profit.

              I started to get contracts for ActionScript development back in 2003. At the time there was a big trend in Flash games / Casino games ; I surfed on it for a while. I then got hired from time to time in different fields and evolved by learning other languages (C, TCL/eggdrop, PHP, ...) ; my projects went from IRC server bots to Flash encapsulated softwares. During  this period I got hooked  on  web development and have continued in this field ever since. I began improving  my workflow  by moving to an  Object-Oriented / MVC  approach. I got several small / mid-sized web projects throughout the years as freelancer beside my other projects.

            Started college in 2009 after a successful Literature Baccalauréat. I earned a Licence of Communication in Bordeaux and then studied Linguistic Science for one additional year. I worked as developer in parallel of all this and decided to stop my formal college studies to focus on my passion which has become SaaS software development and pursuing my business ideas.
